# Convay's Game of Life
##### written in Processing (Version 3.5.4)



Changing Conway's original rules and creating new cell types is possible and encouraged. The code is written as to make modifications to the standard rulesets as well as the creation of new classes for new cell types as easy as possible.

_Examples of both the normal game and one with modifications are included in the **"master" branch** and **"Game_of_Life_Variation" branch**, respectively._
