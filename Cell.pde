// At the moment, the Cell class only keeps track of the state alive / dead.
// To add further sub-classes they must extend the super, Cell

// In each sub-class one can override three methods: clone, transition and display
// clone method: return an identical object as a copy by simply instantiating one of the SAME type with all of the object's same properties
// transition method: this is where you may implement customized rulesets; use getNeighbours to base rules on surrounding cells; use the className-method to create different rules based on a cell's neighbours and their different classes, respectively
// display method: make changes to how the objects should be drawn; appearance may be based on custom class properties to make the cells more expressive visually
